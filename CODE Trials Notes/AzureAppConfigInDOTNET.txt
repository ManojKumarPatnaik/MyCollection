Azure App Config in .Net
=============================
Azure -> AppConfig -> Create -> [Create normal]
- install nuget -Micorsif.Azure.appconfiguration.AspNetCore
- Program.cs
>	webBuilder.ConfigureAppConfiguration(config =>
		{
		var connectionstring = config.Build().GetConnectonString("appconfiguration");// this takes value from appsettings. This is the app config in azure string. Ideally should be in scecrets manager.
		config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(op=> op.Connect(connectionstring);
		op.ConfigureRefresh(refresh =:>
		{
		refresh.Register("weather:count"); //To add for all keys : sentinel key. let say sentinel key is refreshAll
		//the above code becomes : 
		refresh.Register("refreshAll",true);
		.SetCacheExpiration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));//after every 5 second it refreshes
		}
- in the service/controller where want to use value from app config inherit IConfiguration from constructor.
- _configuration.GetValue<int>("weather:count"); // weather:count is the key name.
- these value once updated wont be visible in the app as these were loaded at the time when app started.
- for auto update in app config to app directly in real time : 
	IOptionSnapshot can be used, this will take a class of your keytypes.
	the above class needs to be registered at dependency injection in startup class.
	IConfiguration is already inherited in the startup
	in the configuration method 
		service.Configure<ClassWithAzureconfigKeys>(_config.GetSection("weather");// will refresh keys with postfix of weather.
		
		
		service.AddAzureAppConfiguration();
		also add in configure method
			app.UseAzureAppConfiguration()
			
=> Manage Azure Manage Identity Server- : 
	- Azure auto manage identity in infra and use that to manage authentication between resources.
	- install nuget: Azure.Identity 
	> in program.cs
		config.AddAzureAppConfiguration(op=>
		{
		var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential(new uri("fromappsetting base url"));
