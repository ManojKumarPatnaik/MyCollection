- cloud service providers  : AWS, Azure, GCP
- What are different cloud computing services - Private, Public or Hybrid

- Private cloud services are delivered from a business data center to
internal users.
Public cloud model, a third-party provider delivers the cloud
service over the Internet.
Hybrid cloud is a combination of public cloud services and on-premises
private cloud 

- Types of cloud computing
	- IaaS -  cloud computing offering in which
a vendor provides users access to computing resources such
as storage, networking, and servers.
	-Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing offering that provides
users with a cloud environment in which they can develop, manage, and
deliver applications.
	- Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud computing offering that provides
users with access to a vendor’s cloud-based software. Users do not install
applications on their local devices. 

- Network virtualization is a method of combining the available
resources in a network by splitting up the available bandwidth into
channels, each of which is independent from the others, and each of
which can be assigned (or reassigned) to a particular server or device in
real time. 
-Storage virtualization is the pooling of physical storage from multiple
network storage devices into what appears to be a single storage device
that is managed from a central console.
-Server virtualization is the masking of server resources (including the
number and identity of individual physical servers, processors, and
operating systems) from server users. 

-Virtualization is software that separates physical infrastructures to create
various dedicated resources. It is the fundamental technology that powers
cloud computing. 
-Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)

- Amazon EC2 : tool to create VM.

---------------------------------data science-------------------------------
-Simple Linear Regression: This kind of regression uses only one
independent variable, as shown in the equation above.
• Multiple Linear Regression: The relationship between two or more independent variables and a single dependent variable is estimated using multiple linear regression. 
- logistic regression : In R Programming, logistic regression is a classification algorithm for determining the probability of event success and failure. 
- cycle- 
---------------------------------R------------------------
-- DATA TYPE Allowable Values
Integer 	Values from the Set of Integers, Z
Numeric 	Values from the Set of Real Numbers, R
Complex 	Values from the Set of Complex numbers,
Logical 	Only allowable values are True ; False
Character 	Possible values are -“x”, “@”, “1”, etc
- Dataframe:
A data frame represents a table or a structure similar to an array with two
dimensions It can be interpreted as matrices where each column of that matrix
can be of different data types.

----------------------------Graphics-------------------------------

- OpenGL - graphics Application Programming Interface (API). OpenGL is a library of functions for fast 3D rendering
- GLUT - An OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a complete API that lets you create windows and handle messages
		- set window size  : glutInitWindowSize(640,480); 
- Data types of OpenGL - 	GLint, GLsizei (int) Glfloat, GLclampf (float), Glshort (short)
	function - set background colour : glClearColour(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- bit map : graphic is created from rows of different colored pixels that together form an image.
- 

- ex of software image processing: Graphics Image Processing, Remote Sensing Packages
- CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems allow an engineer to view a design from any angle with the push of a button and to zoom in or out for close-ups and long-distance views.
- Header files : #include <gl\gl.h>, #include<gl\glu.h>, #include <gl\glut.h>

- Display point - glPointSize() 
  Display line -  glLineWidth()
  Stippled Lines (dotted line) -  glLineStipple(Glint factor, Glushort pattern)
  Which function ised to create perpective projection : Void glFrustum(GLdouble left, GLdouble right, GLdouble bottom, GLdouble top,Gldouble near, Gldouble far); 
  Orthographic Projection - void glOrtho(GLdouble left, GLdouble right, GLdouble bottom, GLdouble top,GLdouble near, GLdouble far)

- Ray tracing algo : a ray of light is traced in a backwards direction. That is, we start from the eye or camera and traces the ray through a pixel in the mage plane into the scene and determines what it hits. The pixel is then set to the colour values returned by the ray.


- VRML -  Virtual Reality Modeling Language : file format that defines the layout and content of a 3Dworld with links to more information.

- Point clipping is the technique related to proper display of points in the scene, although, this type of clipping is used less frequently in comparison to other types, i.e., line and polygon clipping.

- Line clipping algo :• Cohen Sutherland algorithm - dividing the
area surrounding the window region into four segments Up, Down, Left, Right
(U,D,L,R) and assignment of number 1 and 0 to respective segments helps in
positioning the region surrounding the window. 
	• Cyrus-Beck of algorithm :  we need to find the value of the parameter t in the parametric representation of the line segment for the point at which the segment intersects the clipping edge.

- Line generation algo :
	• dda algo : uses floating points ,
Digital Difference Analyzer (DDA) algorithm is used to draw lines on a screen in an incrementally. The algorithm is called the Digital Difference Analyzer because it interpolates points based on the difference between the start and end points.
	•Bresenhams Line Generation Algorithm : efficient raster line generation algorithm. This algorithm scan converts lines using only incremental integer calculations and these calculations can also be adopted to display circles and other curves.
