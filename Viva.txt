--------------------------The internet-------------------------
- WAN MAN LAN
- OSI model -An open system is a model that allows any two different systems to communicate
regardless of their underlying architecture.
-Layers of OSI
	- Application layer 
	- Presentation layer
	- Session layer
	- Transport Layer
	- Network layer
	- Data link layer
	- Physical Layer

- packet switching
- ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network)
- Internet Protocol(IP) - The Internet protocol specifies the rules that define the details of how computers
communicate. 
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - TCP makes the Internet reliable. TCP solves many problems that can occur in a packet
switching system.TCP eliminates duplicate data. TCP ensures that the data is reassembled in exactly the order it was sent 
. TCP resends data when a datagram is lost. 

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP
- Intranet vs extranet
	Intranets are basically "small" Internets. They use the same network facllitles that the
lnternet does, but access is restricted to a limited sphere.
	An extranet is network that connects a number of intranets into a truly mini-Internet
Access is extended to all the intranets connected through the extranet, but, again, not
to the Internet. E

- cloud service providers  : AWS, Azure, GCP
- What are different cloud computing services - Private, Public or Hybrid

- Private cloud services are delivered from a business data center to
internal users.
Public cloud model, a third-party provider delivers the cloud
service over the Internet.
Hybrid cloud is a combination of public cloud services and on-premises
private cloud 

- Types of cloud computing
	- IaaS -  cloud computing offering in which
a vendor provides users access to computing resources such
as storage, networking, and servers.
	-Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing offering that provides
users with a cloud environment in which they can develop, manage, and
deliver applications.
	- Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud computing offering that provides
users with access to a vendor’s cloud-based software. Users do not install
applications on their local devices. 

- Network virtualization is a method of combining the available
resources in a network by splitting up the available bandwidth into
channels, each of which is independent from the others, and each of
which can be assigned (or reassigned) to a particular server or device in
real time. 
-Storage virtualization is the pooling of physical storage from multiple
network storage devices into what appears to be a single storage device
that is managed from a central console.
-Server virtualization is the masking of server resources (including the
number and identity of individual physical servers, processors, and
operating systems) from server users. 

-Virtualization is software that separates physical infrastructures to create
various dedicated resources. It is the fundamental technology that powers
cloud computing. 
-Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)

- Amazon EC2 : tool to create VM.

---------------------------------data science-------------------------------
-Simple Linear Regression: This kind of regression uses only one
independent variable, as shown in the equation above.
• Multiple Linear Regression: The relationship between two or more independent variables and a single dependent variable is estimated using multiple linear regression. 
- logistic regression : In R Programming, logistic regression is a classification algorithm for determining the probability of event success and failure. 
- cycle- 
---------------------------------R------------------------
-- DATA TYPE Allowable Values
Integer 	Values from the Set of Integers, Z
Numeric 	Values from the Set of Real Numbers, R
Complex 	Values from the Set of Complex numbers,
Logical 	Only allowable values are True ; False
Character 	Possible values are -“x”, “@”, “1”, etc
- Dataframe:
A data frame represents a table or a structure similar to an array with two
dimensions It can be interpreted as matrices where each column of that matrix
can be of different data types.
