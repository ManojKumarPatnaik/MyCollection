SAGA
=====
- manage data consistency across MS in distributed transaction cases.
- create as set of transaction that update MS sequenctially.
- then publish events to to trigger next transaction for next ms.

- if one step fails then SAGA trigger the rollback transaction for previous ms as well.
Principle used
---------------
	- pub /sub with brokers
	- API composition patterns.
 - Each MS has own db and manage local transaction in atomic way with strict consistency.
 - SAGA group these local transaction and sequenctially inoke each one by one.
 - each local transaction updates db and ublish an event to trigger next local transaction.
 Implementation types
----------------------
	- Choreography 
		- pub/sub principle.
		- each ms publish to message broker system and trigger local transaction in other ms.
		- Dis : decouple direct dependency of ms when managing transaction.
	- Orchestration
		- centralised control of ms through api calls.
		- sequenctial invoking of transaction.
		- Dis: single point failure.
