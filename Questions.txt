Thread safety
-----------------
-> What is the role of volatile keyword in ensuring thread safety, and when should it be used?

-> Explain how to use lock statement in C# to ensure thread-safe access to shared resources. What are some potential issues with using lock and how can they be avoided?

-> Discuss the differences between using Monitor, Mutex, and Semaphore for managing thread synchronization and thread safety. Provide examples of when to use each.

-> can the Thread.MemoryBarrier method be used to enforce a strict ordering of memory operations between threads? Provide an example.

-> cribe the benefits and drawbacks of using ConcurrentDictionary instead of a regular Dictionary with locks for thread-safe operations in a multi-threaded environment.

-> ain the concept of lock contention and how it can impact the performance of a multi-threaded application. What strategies can be employed to reduce lock contention in a C# application?

-> cuss the use of async and await keywords in C# for managing asynchronous operations. How do these keywords help in ensuring thread safety?
