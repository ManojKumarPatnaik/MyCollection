-- Difference  btw IDisposable and Finalize

- Will this work 
class base{
public int x= 10;
public void shw(){}
}
class derived:base{
public int x= 10;
public void shw(){}
}

-Find Output:
	Class A{}
	Class B{}
B b = new A();
A a = new B();

- Will it work
 int sum(int a, int b){}
float sum(int a, int b){}
int sum(int a, int b){}
float sum(int a, int b, int c=0){}

- when we await a function in c#, it wait till the response is recieved. The code doesn't move forward to next line of code (as we see while debugging) How is this asynchronous?
1.
Good question! When you use the await keyword in C#, it allows the current thread to yield control back to its caller until the awaited task completes. This means that the thread is not blocked, but rather it is free to perform other operations while waiting for the awaited task to complete.
When you execute an asynchronous operation, it typically involves performing some I/O operation, such as reading data from a file or sending a network request. When the I/O operation is initiated, the thread is free to perform other operations until the I/O operation completes. Once the I/O operation completes, a callback method is invoked to signal that the operation has finished. At this point, the await keyword resumes execution of the original thread, allowing it to continue processing the result of the asynchronous operation.
So, even though the code appears to be blocking on the await keyword, it is in fact free to perform other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This is what makes it possible to write asynchronous code that can handle multiple requests in parallel, without blocking the main thread of execution
You are correct that the thread cannot move to the next line of code until the awaited operation is complete. However, this does not mean that the thread is blocked from performing other tasks.
2.
Let me explain with an example. Suppose you have a server application that needs to perform an asynchronous database query using the await keyword. While the database query is in progress, the thread is free to handle other incoming requests, perform other calculations, and execute other database queries that do not depend on the result of the awaited operation.

For example, you could have a separate thread or task that handles incoming requests and dispatches them to worker threads. The worker threads can then perform calculations, execute database queries, and handle other tasks that are independent of the awaited operation. Once the awaited operation completes, the thread that was waiting for it can resume processing the result and continue executing the rest of the code.

In this way, the server application can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking any threads. The await keyword allows the application to wait for the completion of an asynchronous operation without blocking the thread, which enables the thread to perform other tasks while waiting.

So, the types of calculations that can be performed while waiting for an awaited operation in a server application depend on the design of the application and the tasks that are independent of the awaited operation. It could be calculations for handling other requests, performing data processing, or any other task that does not depend on the result of the awaited operation.
