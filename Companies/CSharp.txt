-- Difference  btw IDisposable and Finalize

- Will this work 
class base{
public int x= 10;
public void shw(){}
}
class derived:base{
public int x= 10;
public void shw(){}
}

-Find Output:
	Class A{}
	Class B{}
B b = new A();
A a = new B();

- Will it work
 int sum(int a, int b){}
float sum(int a, int b){}
int sum(int a, int b){}
float sum(int a, int b, int c=0){}

- when we await a function in c#, it wait till the response is recieved. The code doesn't move forward to next line of code (as we see while debugging) How is this asynchronous?
Good question! When you use the await keyword in C#, it allows the current thread to yield control back to its caller until the awaited task completes. This means that the thread is not blocked, but rather it is free to perform other operations while waiting for the awaited task to complete.
When you execute an asynchronous operation, it typically involves performing some I/O operation, such as reading data from a file or sending a network request. When the I/O operation is initiated, the thread is free to perform other operations until the I/O operation completes. Once the I/O operation completes, a callback method is invoked to signal that the operation has finished. At this point, the await keyword resumes execution of the original thread, allowing it to continue processing the result of the asynchronous operation.
So, even though the code appears to be blocking on the await keyword, it is in fact free to perform other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This is what makes it possible to write asynchronous code that can handle multiple requests in parallel, without blocking the main thread of execution
