- How to use exception handing in aspnetcore?
- Answer:- Exception handling in AspNetCore can be done in 3 places based on requirement.\

- Code level(Using try/catch)\
- Controller level (using action filter IExceptionFilter)
- Don't have before and after events.
- Implement OnException or OnExceptionAsync.
- Handle unhandled exceptions that occur in Razor Page or controller creation, model binding, action filters, or action methods.
- Do not catch exceptions that occur in resource filters, result filters, or MVC result execution.
- Globally(using UseExceptionHandler middle ware)\
- NOTE:- When to use what?
- Concerned about errors in AspNet Framework level useMiddleWare.
- Concerned about errors in MyCode UseFilter.
